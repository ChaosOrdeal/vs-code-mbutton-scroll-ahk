This is a fork.

Added functionality: when clicking MMB and releasing to scroll, LMB terminates scrolling.

This is in addition to the original functionality wherein MMB held down scrolls, and releasing terminates, and MMB click-and-release initiates scrolling, and a second MMB click-and-release terminates scrolling.
